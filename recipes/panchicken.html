       <h4>Recipe Description</h4>
       <p>
           As an attempt to be healthier this year, I tried my best to learn a few different chicken breast recipes, especially when I was cutting weight down. Although commonly hated for its dry texture, a well-cooked chicken breast can be remarkably juicy and delicious as well.
       </p>
       <p>
        The key to this, however, is using a meat thermometer. Any cheap one will do, but it is the easiest way to avoid the dry, tasteless texture
        that chicken breasts are commonly known for. I hope you all can enjoy this simple and quick way to cook an outstanding chicken breast!

       <h3>Ingredients</h3>

       
        <ul>
            <li>2-3 boneless, skinless chicken breasts</li>
            <li>olive or other oil</li>
            <li>stainless or cast-iron pan</li>
            <li>meat thermometer
            </li>
            <li>kosher salt to taste</li>
            <li>freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>smoked paprika (optional)</li>
        </ul>


        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to ~190 Celsius / 375 Fahrenheit.</li>
            <li>Place pan on highest heat available (and turn on oven fan!)</li>
            <li>Pat chicken breasts dry with a paper towel, then season generously with salt, pepper, and paprika if using.</li>
            <li>When pan is rippingly hot, add a few splashes of oil, carefully place chicken in pan, and start a timer.</li>
            <li>When timer reaches 2 minutes, carefully flip chicken pieces over and turn off heat.</li>
            <li>Very carefully transfer pan (with chicken) into the preheated oven.</li>
            <li>Check the temperature after total time of 6 minutes! The temperature for a fully-cooked chicken breast is 160 F. When testing, make sure to probe the largest, thickest part of each piece.</li>
            <li>As the chicken's internal temperature will continue to raise while resting, you may pull the pieces when they reach around 155 F.
            </li>
            <li>When the chicken reaches the target temperature, take the pieces out of the pan and place on a deep plate or bowl to cool.</li>
            <li>After allowing the chicken to rest a few minutes, enjoy!! Don't forget to save/reserve/use all the juice that comes out as well!</li>
        </ol>
