        Deceivingly simple, these cookies display a particularly deep flavor, helped greatly by toasting the nuts beforehand. They have been a go-to cookie to bake and bring for holiday parties in my family for years, and it is my great hope that you can bake and enjoy them with your family and loved ones as well!

       <h3>Ingredients</h3>

       
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup unsalted butter at room temperature</li>
            <li>1/3 cup confectioners'sugar</li>
            <li>1 cup finely chopped/ground walnuts</li>
            <li>1/8 tsp of salt
            </li>
            <li>1 tsp real vanilla extract</li>
            <li>2 cups AP flour (plus 2 tbsp extra in case of wet dough)</li>
            <li>appx 1 cup additional confectioners'sugar for dusting</li>
        </ul>


        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>In a dry pan, toast the ground or chopped walnuts over medium heat, stirring frequently.</li>
            <li>Transfer the walnuts to a bowl to cool.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 175 Celsius / 350 Fahrenheit.</li>
            <li>Place butter, powdered sugar, cooled walnuts, salt, flour, and vanilla all in a bowl. WIth your hands, mix thoroughly until all the flour and butter is evenly mixed, and the dough can readily be formed into balls that hold their shape.</li>
            <li>Take pieces of dough and roll them into round balls approximately 1 inch in size, or weigh them out for better consistancy. 30g per ball is a good starting place.</li>
            <li>Place the balls on a silicone baking mat. They do not need to be too far apart, as there will not be much spreading.</li>
            <li>Bake in preheated oven until well golden and brown on the top, anywhere from 10-20 minutes, depending on your chosen size of ball and your particular oven. Keep an eye out, they can change quickly!</li>
            <li>After pulling out of the oven, let cool for 5 minutes, then roll/toss them in the remaining confectioners'sugar and place them on a rack to cool.</li>
            <li>After cooling completely, give the cookies one final toss in the confectioners'sugar.</li>
            <li>They are now ready to eat. Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
